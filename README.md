If you want to modify the code, you need to re-create the .exe file because it doesn't have the changes that you do. So, open cmd in the same path and paste this command, that command include every .class (and other added file) generated by running the whole code with an IDE, by default is this:

jar cmf manifest.txt SnakeGame.jar GameFrame.class backgroundingame.png GamePanel.class GamePanel$1.class GamePanel$2.class GamePanel$MyKeyAdapter.class image.png SnakeGame.class WelcomeScreen.class WelcomeScreen$1.class WelcomeScreen$2.class winGameImage.png WinPanel.class WinPanel$1.class WinPanel$2.class

Then install Launch4J to convert the jar file into an executable file.

If you just want to play, there is an .exe file prebuilt for you ðŸ˜€
